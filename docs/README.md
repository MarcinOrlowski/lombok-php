## Requirements ##

* PHP 8.0 or newer

---

## Installation ##

Add `Lombok PHP` to your project dependency list:

```php
composer require marcin-orlowski/lombok-php
```

---

## Usage ##

Now, further usage depends on type of annotations you wish to use. As PHP annotations do not
work just by themselves automagically, you need to wire your classes with `Lombok PHP` yourself.

### Using helper class ###

The simplest approach is to extend `\Lombok\Helper` class which will set it all up for you.

```php
class Entity extends \Lombok\Helper {
    ...
```

### Manual wiring ###

Alternatively, if use of `Lombok\Helper` is not possible, you need to implement the following
methods:

In your class' constructor call Lombok's `construct()` method to set your object up:

```php
public function __construct() {
    \Lombok\Lombok::construct($this);
}
```

Then you need to implement [class destructor](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php)
to ensure Lombok knows your object is gone so it shall clean some internals up:

```php
public function __destruct() {
    \Lombok\Lombok::destruct($this);
}
```  

**IMPORTANT** This step is crucial as `Lombok PHP` must know when object it supports is
being destroyed and to remove its internal configuration. It's because the `spl_object_id()`
is used internally to identify each object and returned identifier is only guaranteed to be
unique during object's lifetime. The method is explicitely documented to reuse identifiers
of destroyed objects for new ones, so it could lead to unexpected results if old object
configuration is still in place without the cleanup step.

Finally the `__call()` is need to let `Lombok PHP` do the heavy lifting.

```php
public function __call(string $methodName, array $args) {
    return \Lombok\Lombok::call($this, $methodName, $args);
}
```

## Limitations ##

* Due to how PHP annotations work, any class using `Lombok PHP` must either extend provided
  `\Lombok\Helper` class or as wire magic methods. See documentation for more details.
* By design, `Lombok PHP` does not support accessors for properties with `public` visibility
  (as this simply makes little sense) nor `static` properties.
* Visibility of generated accessors is always `public` in current implementation but more
  control is to be added shortly.
* As all methods provided by `Lombok PHP` are handled on-the-fly, some IDEs or static analysers
  cam complain about calling non-existing method. And because IDEs are not aware of `Lombok PHP`
  yet, they will also not offer auto-completion for methods provided by `Lombok PHP`, so if you got
  any idea how to address the latter, please speak up!
